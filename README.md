# Shield Wizard

Shield Wizard is a reinforcement learning project where an AI agent learns to defend against incoming attacks and counter-attack the opponent. The agent uses **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** to strategically shield against bullets shot by a wizard and retaliate effectively.

## Features
- **Reinforcement Learning with PPO**: The agent is trained using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**.
- **Unity ML-Agents Integration**: Utilizes **Unity ML-Agents Toolkit** for training and simulation.
- **Deep Learning with PyTorch & TensorFlow**: Implements neural networks for decision-making.
- **Training Visualization**: Supports **TensorBoard** for monitoring training progress.

## Technologies Used
- Unity
- Unity ML-Agents
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow
- TensorBoard

## Running the Simulation
Once the training is complete, you can run the trained model inside Unity by executing the trained `.onnx` file and observing how the agent defends and counter-attacks dynamically.

## Future Improvements
- Fine-tuning the reward function for better strategic play.
- Experimenting with different RL algorithms for comparison.
- Enhancing visual effects and adding more enemy attack patterns.
